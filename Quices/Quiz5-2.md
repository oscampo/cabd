COD:

Identify the 7 figures of your student ID in the following way: **ABCDEFG**.
Use that key as data for this question:

1. Determine the probability of failure of a spring-leaf prosthetic foot subjected to a transverse load of 1400 $\pm$ **ABC** N on the ankle. The foot is made of a steel with a yield strength of 1613 $\pm$ **CDE** MPa.

2. An archwire for orthodontic brackets has a diameter of 0.3 mm. The free length between brackets is 20 mm, the applied activation force  is  30 $\pm$3.15 N. The archwire material is a Ti-Alloy with a yield strength of 450 MPa (SD=5% of the Yield Strength). The probability of failure for this condition is 1.6%. If you want to increase reliability to 99.99% or more, which one of the following strategies is the most feasible and why? A) Change the diameter of the archwire. B) Change the archwire material. Suppose the principal loads on the archwire are tensile. Table 4.1 shows the possible materials for this application. Suppose SD=5% of the Yield Strength for all cases.
